# 🧠 Waste Classifier with Smart Bin Recommendation ♻️

This is a **deep learning web app** that classifies an image of waste (plastic, glass, metal, cardboard, paper, or trash) and recommends the appropriate disposal bin based on **Ontario’s blue/black bin system**. Users can drag and drop an image, and the app will instantly return a prediction with emoji-labeled feedback, confidence level, and disposal instructions.
